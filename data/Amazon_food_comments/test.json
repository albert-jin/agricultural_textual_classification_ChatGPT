I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix.

One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it.

{"text": "The Grove Square Capuccino Cups are just great.  A real treat!  Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.

If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.

First off the overall portion size is small and they use a very small pasta shell (it has to be seen to be believed). You get more pasta not to mention much bigger pasta shells in the Kraft mac and cheese version and personally I think they taste better despite not being organic.  Perhaps if youre just buying this for children this might suffice but if youre looking to eat this as a meal or even as a side and there`s more than one person and/or you have even an average appetite I`d look elsewhere or just plan on cooking two boxes.  As far as flavor is concerned and the final product... I followed the directions and mixed the recommended amount of milk with the powder cheese mix and it came out more like soup than anything even closely resembling mac and cheese.  Not sure what they were going for here but I definitely dont get what all these 5-star reviews are about.  I even tried adding a few slices of kraft cheddar and it still was soupy.  Then I substituted margarin for milk as some other reviewers had suggested and although it was more palatable (only reason I didnt give it one star) I was still very disappointed.  There was hardly enough cheese for half the shells muchless the entire box.  Maybe if they used larger shells and gave you a lot more of the powder cheese Id consider reviewing it again but given the portion police state we live in I doubt either will happen.

My 3.5 year old son was fed these for a snack at church and he became incredibly irritable and violent the rest of the day. He was hitting other kids and his parents for no reason the rest of the day. He also had a horible sleep that night. He has a known corn sensitivity but no one expected that \"\"shortbread\"\" would have corn in it. It has the worst kind of corn which is high fructose corn syrup. That stuff is horrible for kids and based on my experiences with my son I think it causes a large amount of the behavior problems that kids have.

The ratings were not very impressive compare<br />to other Lavazza Whole Beans ( very close to Lavazza Super crema which i<br />have ordered through Amazon )but i wanted to make my own experience .<br /><br />When i oppened the package i saw seemingly oily coffee beans compare to other Lavazza or Illy Espresso beans.<br /><br />I have a Miele automatic espresso machine which was not very amused about<br />his new partner but it was too late to refuse the experiment.<br /><br />Grand Espresso has  a very good Crema which is a result of high Robusta  and normal bucket( aroma ) .Composition 40% Arabica 60 % Robusta .<br /><br />As Cappuccino i was not very impressed compare to other Lavazza Espresso<br />Beans .It tastes very weak ( i have used Whole Foods Whole Milk ).<br /><br />At the end you get what you have paid for. A lavazza brand which is in the<br />bottom of Lavazza Whole beans next to Lavazza super Crema and Lavazza Tierra.<br /><br />For me the first choice for Lavazza Espresso is Pienaroma if it is fresh ( i<br />have bought it through Amazon for about two years ago which was damaged/sour<br />but otherwise it is the top choice and the most expencive Lavazza in Europe)made from 100 % Arabica Beans and very Espresso Machine friendly like all other Lavazza beans (except Grand Espresso ! ) followed by Lavazza Top class.<br /><br />For Cappuccino my first choice is Lavazza Top Class which has a very nice chocolaty and sweet note followed by none ( even better than illy).<br /><br />For me the best Espresso is Illy dark roast (unfortunately overpriced )<br />followed by Lavazza Pienaroma ( best price/Quality ) .<br /><br />For Cappuccino i would always go with Lavazza top class followed by Segafredo<br />Extra Strong .<br /><br />I would not recommend Lavazza Grand espresso for espresso machines a la Miele<br />or Jura .The fat beans would cause damages for espresso machines .<br /><br />If you have regular / filter coffee machine i would see it comparable to Lavazza Super Crema or Tierra (which i also would definately NOT buy again ).\t,", "label": 0}

The Sovena Inc. Customer Service Rep. took a week to get back to me and then explained that this is a \"\"blend\"\" and should not be chilled.  He could not tell me what is  in this blend and said that it will take time for him to research and get an answer for me.  I am still waiting for his response (almost 2 weeks later).  I subsequently purchased Botticelli Olive Oil to see if it reacted the same way when chilled and  thankfully it did not.  I made the exact same tomato salad using the 2 brands of oil and the Oliveri blend encased the tomatoes in a greasy thick disgusting mess.  The tomato salad made with the Botticelli Oil looked as appetizing when I took it out of the fridge as it did when I put it in.<br /><br />Tomato Salad Recipe:<br />2 ripe vine tomatoes - cut in large cubes<br />1/2 cup olive oil - (I recommend Botticelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil)<br />3 cloves crushed garlic<br />1 tsp. salt<br />1/2 tsp. oregano<br />Mix ingredients together\t,", "label": 0}
